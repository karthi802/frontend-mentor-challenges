## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this practice project I tried out the mobile-first workflow like the card for the mobile and using the media query to adjust to the desktop screen size, like

```css
@media only screen and (min-width: 768px){
  .container{
    ...
  }
  ...
}
```
I also learned to use the percentage(%) representation of width instead of pixels(px). So I had fun doing, learning and the mistakes I was doing with this projectðŸ˜‹

### Continued development

I want to learn to use rem instead of px and make the website more responsive.
